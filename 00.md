# Falling Lightning

The sprawling metropolis of Yharnam had started as a small, pleasant hamlet on the shores of a gleaming silver lake. When the king built keeps across the land to defend against invaders from all sides, a great castle was established on the island in the lake's heart. The town grew to feed the castle and its noble knights, and they grew strong from the lake's bounty.

For generations, the Margrave Cainhurst protected their western border – first against the Wyrmlord and then against the Conqueror who rode from the south when that great monarch vanished. With their strength, the lords and the city grew arrogant each in their own way. In the generations since the Conqueror's passing, there was little threat, and now the knights of Cainhurst were more vain than proud.

The lords of Cainhurst cared little for the management of the city, so long as it continued to fund their nightly debauches, and that suited the city fine. The city, so protected and fed by the lake, had grown to believe itself much a nation of its own. It cared little for news of the Capital, much less of other kingdoms.

The latter alone frustrated the lords of Cainhurst, who had come to love the rare and exotic after centuries of taking spoils in battle. A decree was passed that if any outsider bore an invitation to the castle that they be allowed to pass posthaste to the old lakeside lane where a black carriage would await them.

Presently, two fashions gripped the castle.

The more leisurely lords had developed a fondness for duelling with pistols only paces apart. All those who still remembered the fallen land at the western end of the earth were ageless mercenaries, and the lords had found a gunsmith among them. Each new pistol evoked the silvern decadence of the Wyrmlord's palace.

The lower knights expressed their bloodthirst much more purely. By chance, a blade from the Most Distant East had been given to the Margrave as gift. Not only was it beautiful in its simplicity, but it was the ideal weapon. Gone were their armored foes of old. The once-proud knights now fought little more than imported beasts or men. A fine, curved blade was the purest tool for slicing flesh from bone or evoking elegant arterial spray.

Certainly, the various captured or drugged smiths in the castle could make similar sabers, but it just wasn't the same. They needed authentic instruction. So too did the knights lust for the swordplay which would complete the elegance of their bladework. As before, they sought out a mercenary who knew of these Eastern Lands. How fortunate that one was an acquaintance of the gunsmith!

They would be busy later, but for now, the sun was high in the sky. The lords and knights would be nursing hangovers if they were awake at all. The two mercenaries sat on a low cliff far from the castle. A girl from a knightly household stood behind them, begging with hands clasped.

"Please, won't you teach me just a little!"

The Eastern mercenary was wearing a sky-blue robe with a pattern on it – some sort of flowering tree. Her hair was the earthen black of rich, deep soil. She let the ridiculous mass flow freely when she wasn't fighting or instructing, and it was tangled like the roots of a greatwood. In spite of how seriously the knights took her and her swordsmanship, she was currently using her own much-desired blade as a fishing rod.

Her eyes were closed, and there was a sort of sleepy half-smile on her face. She tilted her head and looked back without opening her eyes.

"Do you really want to learn? Do you know what it really, _truly_ means to wield a sword?"

The girl kneaded her long, wine-and-gold dress. It was tattered at the bottom. This wasn't the first time she'd snuck out to these cliffs, and her family was not so well-off as to replace them every time she did.

"I–! I have no choice, do I? If I wish to see the world beyond this lake."

"There are other ways. The wealth of this castle is great, and they have little need of it. It would be no great sin to steal enough to pay your way."

"I could leave Yharnam like that? Without being dragged back?"

"The timing would be difficult, yes. But learning the strategy involved would be a worthier pursuit than learning the blade."

The girl stood silent, and the warrior gave her time to think. The other woman, the gunsmith, had been quietly contemplating the lake the whole time. She furrowed her brow and stared into the water as if she could almost see something.

After a moment, the warrior added, "I realize that this is not what you wanted to hear. It is true that fighting strength is still strength of a sort. There are times when wielding a blade are unavoidable. Yet, am I not a hypocrite for training knights who have no more enemies to fight? This world is not peaceful, and its inhabitants are often unkind.

I have won my battles of the sword for now, but rebuilding is my new battle. My strength now is my contract fee. Every coin I send home lays another board on one of my people's homes. Seeing the world is a grand adventure. But you are only in a small lake now. What will you do once you reach the great sea? What strength will you need among its currents?"

The girl was still silent, but she was grimacing firmly now. Determination shone in her eyes, but she couldn't quite put it to words yet. The gunsmith backed away from the edge and turned to the warrior.

"You're right. There's something down there. Can't tell what. Spiritual shit's never been my forte, so I sent for the college's groundskeeper when you asked. Not his best subject either, but at least he won't turn us down because of the Castle."

She turned and gestured toward the castle a long, dark shape was approaching the front gate.

"That looks like him now. I'll run and grab him."

She had tanned skin from a life in the sun and in front of forgefires. It was a stark difference from the pale skin and silvery hair of the island's inhabitants or even the citizens across the lake. Her outfit today was just a common shirt and trousers like any of the townsfolk, though she did not wear shoes. Her left arm and both legs looked to be armored, but they were actually prosthetics of laquered wood.

The artificial legs didn't seem to slow her at all as she bounded away. The speed of her departure did leave the girl alone with her thoughts and the warrior.

After a minute or so, she said, "Lady T-"

The water below began to burble loudly. A shadow was cast onto lake from below.

The warrior raised her hand and barked in a hushed voice, "Get back. Slowly. Keep backing up. Don't run. Don't break eye contact if it sees you."

The girl followed her instructions as she steadily rose and loosened her fishing line from the end of her scabbard before tucking the cable into her belt. The weapon was unusual beyond even its foreign design. It had the bastard sword length of a typical imported weapon, but the hilt was as long as a shortspear. She didn't draw it yet but held it at the ready.

In a flash of silvery water, something burst into the air, rising above the cliff to face the warrior directly. It was a thing of primeval nightmare, the sort of serpent northmen once carved into the prows of their raiding ships. It glimmered like moonlight, and tendrils danced about its snout like a beard and eyebrows.

"O master of the waters," the warrior said firmly, "if you have grievance with this household, this humble maiden shall force them bend knee. But if you are so consumed by emotion that you heed not these words, then I am duty-bound to stop you."

The serpent loomed over her. The top of its snout was smooth and featureless, shining like a membrane to show the brain within. The creature paused for a moment, and only the bubbling of the still-boiling water could be heard.

The girl took another step away from the cliffside and the beast. There were no eyes. Where was she to look? So distracted, she stumbled and caught the creature's attention.

It flashed as it moved, blinding her. But the swordswoman had yet to open her eyes. There was a second flash as her blade moved like lightning. The serpent shrieked and veered off course. Sky-colored blood splattered over the cliffside and the warrior as half of the monster's "mustache" fell shuddering to the water below.

The beast immediately forgot about the girl and glared at the warrior with its eyeless membrane. She glared back undaunted with three eyes.

"Stay your wrath, o lord, lest you find mine."

The monster hissed again and swung wide. It couldn't lunge again with so much of its neck on the cliff, but it could certainly sweep the human into its domain. It was simply too large to leap over. The warrior knelt and held her strange weapon with both hands, as if bracing a spear to intercept a charge.

The beast and warrior hurtled into the air together but neither fell. Thunder pealed, and the serpent shuddered and shrieked in pain. The woman hung from her sword, a single-shot pistol shaped like a dragon smoking in her hand.

The serpent tried to shake her free. Failing that, it dove for the water. There would be nothing she could do then. This of course presumed she had never fought monsters before. The cable on her belt arced to the cliffside. As the hook caught on a crevice, she pulled her blade free. Just as the monster splashed down, she arced back upward, using the speed the monster had given her to run up the cliff face.

She saw the girl half-hiding behind a stone, watching the battle unfold.

"Run!" the warrior yelled. "This is not the sort of battle one may win alone. I will hold its attention until the others arrive. We cannot let it flee now that it holds hatred for humans. It may attack the fishermen next."

"What can you do?" the girl yelled back. "Why would you save those people when they hate all of us?"

"I still have trick up my sleeve. And it is the right thing to do. Everyone deserves a second chance."

The warrior slipped her left shoulder from her robe. Her forearm was a tattered mass of scar tissue. She held it aloft and drew her blade along it. Deep, bruise-colored blood spilled out, not holding together but falling like rain. As it passed over the blade, golden sparks burst into life. The electricity was like nothing natural, a bright yellow that burned like the sun.

The woman crooked her arm to staunch the bleeding and tucked it into the right side of her robe like a sling. In spite of her weapon's length, she held it steadily in one hand with the strength of an ogre. The golden electricity danced over her blade with a cry like birdsong and glinted in her three eyes.

The serpent rose again, and she swung at the air. A bolt hurtled from her blade and struck the patch of flesh descaled by her pistol shot. The lightning arced throughout the creature, and it roared in confused pain.

"Run! I'll hold it back!"

It lashed forward again, and the warrior swept under, her blade effortlessly cutting the soft flesh beneath its jaw. It smashed the ground, and she lept into the air. Two steps, and she was on its back. Using the long handle again, she thrust her blade like a spear into the back of its neck.

The monster fumed and twisted against the rocks. The warrior was forced to abandon her weapon to avoid being crushed. It snarled at her and began to wind up, but she threw some sort of incindiary paper to startle it. It reared back and seemed to take a deep breath. A dragon's breath would certainly follow. Frightening as it sounded, the warrior simply had to avoid it.

She took a split second to look away. The gunsmith and the university groundskeeper were only a few hundred yards away, and it seemed the sounds of battle had roused the lords and knights early. She would be paid well for this. The good she could do with the money would pay for the sin of slaying such a creature.

Then she saw the girl had not fled.

Before she could think, her body had moved. Perhaps the serpent knew it would never have hit her with its breath. That was the sort of thing wily serpents knew, wasn't it?

She shielded the girl from the blast, but whether the beam was energy or pressurized water, it vaporized her back as she heaved the girl just out of its angle.

Still, she caught herself on one knee. She gently wrapped her good arm around the girl as her body collapsed without a spine.

"Do not forget," she said. "There are greater strengths than the blade alone."

"Lady Tomoe!"

There was an ear-shattering burst, and a cannonball tore through the serpent's eyeless face.

"Tomoe!" the gunsmith shouted.

The other woman carefully peeled the bloodsoaked warrior from the frozen girl, but the body fell to pieces. The gunsmith was saying something. A lot of things, actually. And swearing quite creatively. But the girl didn't hear any of it. She looked at the monster and the puddle of gore oozing beneath it. The lords and knights had begun to gather around it. Some were testing their blades as if the woman who taught them hadn't just died.

"A shame," a gruff stranger said.

It wasn't clear whether the man in the worn coat was talking about the death of the creature or of the warrior. He looked between the two, and a tall hat hid his expression for a moment. Then he turned to the girl.

"Were you close?"

"No, but… she treated me like… someone. Someone who could choose my fate."

"The way I see it, there's a clear choice to be made still. This beast… it wasn't the first, and it won't be the last. We're forming an outfit to hunt them, even if Master Willem won't hear it. We need strong souls that won't look away from this bloody work. I think you have the potential for it. My name is Gehrman. How about yourself, young lady?"

"Maria."
